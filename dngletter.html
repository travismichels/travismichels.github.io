	<h3 class="dngletterletter">               Greetings from Sweden! I have been here a little over a week 
	and so far it is going great. I figured since I am no longer arround the office to provide candy
	I would send you some from Sweden. I also figured that while writing a letter and
	including it in the package would be much easier this is more fun, more astetically pleasing
	(hopefully) and gives me more freedom to do things (like include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIrEM_9qvZU">links</a> to cat videos)
