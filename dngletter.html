	<h1 class="dngletterhello">Hello DNG Team!</h1>
	<h3 class="dngletterletter">Greetings from Sweden! I have been here a little over a week 
	and so far it is going great. Right now I am on the mainland in a city called Motala with my Aunt and Cousins.
	Tomorrow I am going to my gransparents house which is on an island called Gotland. <br><br>I know that writing
	a letter and including it in the package would be much easier...But this is more fun, more astetically pleasing
	(hopefully), and gives me freedom to do more things (like include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIrEM_9qvZU">links</a> to cat
	videos.)  Anyways, I figured since I am no longer arround the office to provide candy, I would send you
	some from Sweden - give 'yall some <i>real</i> Swedish Fish :P<br><br>I included a bunch of different candies for
	variaty, but Kex is my favorite. I've been eating it as long as I can remember. My other
	favorite is Diam. It's very comperable to a Heath bar - but better. The most popular chocolate in Sweden is Marabou
	and it's pretty darn good too. Definetly my favorite chocolate bar. Basicaly all of these are better than any American candy. </h3>
