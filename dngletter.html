	<h1 class="dngletterhello">Hello DNG Team!</h1>
	<h3 class="dngletterletter">Greetings from Sweden! I have been here a little over a week 
	and so far it is going great. Right now I am on the mainland in a city called Motala with my Aunt and Cousins.
	Tomorrow I am going to my gransparents house which is on an island called Gotland. <br><br>I know that while writing
	a letter and including it in the package would be much easier...But this is more fun, more astetically pleasing
	(hopefully), and gives me freedom to do more things (like include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIrEM_9qvZU">links</a> to cat
	videos.)<br>I figured since I am no longer arround the office to provide candy
	I would send you some from Sweden.</h3>
