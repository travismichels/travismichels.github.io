	<h1 class="dngletterhello">Hello DNG Team!</h1>
	<div>
	<h3 class="dngletterletter">Greetings from Sweden! I have been here a little over a week 
	and so far it's great. Right now I am on the mainland in a city called Motala with my Aunt and Cousins.
	Tomorrow I am going to my grandparents house which is on an island called Gotland. I've got another 2 weeks before I come back!<br><br>I know that writing
	a letter and including it in the package would be much easier...But this is more fun, more aesthetically pleasing
	(hopefully), and gives me freedom to do more things (like include <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIrEM_9qvZU">links</a> to cat
	videos.)  Anyways, I figured since I am no longer around the office to provide candy, I would send you
	some from Sweden!<br><br>I included a bunch of different candies for
	variety, but Kex is my favorite. I've been eating it as long as I can remember. My other
	favorite is Diam. It's very comparable to a Heath bar - but better. The most popular chocolate in Sweden is Marabou
	and it's pretty darn good too. Basically, Swedish 
	candy is better than American candy. I tried as hard as I could to find Swedish Fish but belive it or not, they pretty much don't exist
	here. My mom said she'd never had Swedish Fish until she moved to the USA (When she was about 20.)<br><br>I hope you enjoy - do your best to not eat it all in a day.
	Keep NOCing out all the tickets (see what I did there?) and doin' stuff the DNG way.<br><br></br>
	Hope to see you all soon,<br>Travis<br><br><span class="pspart">P.S - I think they might be more obsessed with Pokemon here than in the 
	US. Holy cow have I been playing a lot! I'm a pretty good level now ;)</span></h3>
