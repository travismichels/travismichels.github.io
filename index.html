			From today's featured article Mereka Bilang, 
			Saya Monyet! (released internationally as They Say I'm a Monkey!) is a 2008 
			Indonesian film directed by Djenar Maesa Ayu. Starring Titi Rajo Bintang, Henidar Amroe, 
			and Ray Sahetapi, it tells the life story of Adjeng, who was sexually abused as a child
			by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18 days after several years of development, the
			film adapted two of Ayu's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing
			to its low budget of Rp 620 million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, 
			although several established actors appeared at reduced rates. Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet!
			has been described as "anti-Sjuman" because of the disparity between Ayu's more personal 
			directing style and the social realism of her father, Sjumandjaja. Although commercially
			unsuccessful, the film was well received by critics. It won five national-level awards 
			and was screened at several international film festivals. Two Indonesian publications,
			Tempo and The Jakarta Post, selected it as among the best films of 2008. (Full article...)
